### Generation: Data can be generated from 
            - Web Sites
            - Sensors
            - Forms/Feedback
            - Analytics

#### Ingestion: 
Fetching data from multiple sources for ex. If data is realtime we can use Kafka.

#### Storage: Storing all the data that you fetched from multiple sources like amazon S3 I've used.

#### Transformation: Based on business logic or other requirments, doing a transformation.

*Undercurrents: are also very important course for data engineering life cycle.*
*Security* : Data should be secure as its most important 

*Data Management* : As Data Engineer one can create say data dictionary like which data is where what it is about so others can easily understand.

*DataOps* : Similar to DevOps say if we change tranformation logic then it should reflect to the entire system

*Data architechure*: Choosing the right tools to do the work

*Orchestration*: Order of execution is called orchestration like after ingestion transformation and afterwards serving like that 

*Software Engineering best practice is also important.

# *What is Data Warehouse*

A Data warehouse is a **centralized repository** that stores data from <mark>from various sources, such as transactional systems(mysql, sqlserver,postgresql etc), applications (google map, youtube etc,) and external sources( like sensors)</mark>.

It is designed to support business intelligence activites, such as reporting, analysis, and data myining. Unlike transactional databases, which are designed for day-to-day operations,<mark> data warehouses are designed for complex quries and analyis.</mark>
